## My process

I usually code my container first, then the main section of my component, then I divided it into 3 columns using Bootstrap. A lot of margin and padding classes are used to make spaces for each content.

Somehow I started with desktop first, and then use `@media` query to make it responsive.

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Bootstrap
